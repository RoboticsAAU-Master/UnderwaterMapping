{prefix}{test_number},{testtype}_{turbidity_level}_{marine_snow}_{trial}

prefix:
	_ = pretest
	  = actual test

testnumber,testtype:
	1,1 = predefined test, rectangular 
	1,2 = predefined test, curved with orientation following path
	1,3 = predefined test, curved with orientation swaying (actually just random rotation)
	2,1 = feature loss, landmark track
	2,2 = feature loss, camera angle tilt
	
turbidity_level: 
	0 = None
	1 = Level 1 (50 ml)
	2 = Level 2 (100 ml)

marine_snow: 
	0 = None
	1 = Low (1.5 g)
	2 = Medium (3 g)
	3 = High (4.5 g)

trial: Integer representing specific test trial number [1,inf)

Example:
"_1,1_0_0_1.csv" corresponds to pretest of predefined test with rectangular motion and zero turbidity or marine snow for trial number 1
